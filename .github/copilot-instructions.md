# Copilot working rules

- Always open and review the living plan at PLAN.md before starting any work. If the plan is missing steps for the intended change, add them before proceeding.
- Keep the living plan updated: adjust statuses as you work, add newly discovered tasks, and mark completions before ending a session.
- Do not begin coding if the plan and your next steps are out of sync; reconcile PLAN.md first so you stay on track.
- Use ASCII for edits; add brief comments only when logic is non-obvious.
- Prefer apply_patch for single-file edits; avoid destructive git commands and do not revert user changes you did not make.
- Read any relevant instruction files before editing matching paths (e.g., repository or task-specific guides) and follow them.
